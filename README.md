# Car Sales Dashboard ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project involves the design and development of a dynamic **Car Sales Dashboard** using **Power BI** to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to a car dealership's sales data. The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by providing insights into trends, performance metrics, and growth opportunities.

## Features
The **Car Sales Dashboard** consists of two main pages:
1. **Overview Page:** A high-level snapshot of critical sales KPIs and trends.
2. **Details Page:** A comprehensive view of individual car sales transactions.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- **Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales**
- **Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales**
- **Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Sales**
- **YTD vs. Previous YTD Sales (PTYD)**
- **YTD and MTD Average Price of Cars**
- **Cars Sold (YTD and MTD)**
- **YOY Growth in Cars Sold**
- **Comparison between YTD and PTYD Cars Sold**

### Visualizations:
1. **YTD Sales Weekly Trend:** A line chart showing weekly YTD sales trends.
2. **YTD Total Sales by Body Style:** A pie chart visualizing the distribution of sales by car body style.
3. **YTD Total Sales by Color:** A pie chart representing sales distribution based on car color.
4. **YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region:** A map chart displaying the geographical distribution of sales.
5. **Company-Wise Sales Trends:** A tabular grid that highlights the sales performance of different car brands.
6. **Details Grid:** A detailed grid providing information on individual sales transactions, including the car model, color, dealer, sales amount, etc.

## Objectives
